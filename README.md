### Code

 * Navbar Menu was taken from Whiskey Drop Project from Code Institute with Bootstrap, but I simplified it and added my own styling with CSS.
 * Used Bootstrap for the responsive structure in whole project.
 * [quiz](https://code-boxx.com/simple-javascript-quiz/)
 I used the structure of the code, I changed it for my needs and styled it to match the page.
 * Booking form was taken from the Bootstrap component section and modified for the project.

## Deployment

1. Created repository with the title of the page "Explore-Ethiopia".
2. I worked on my site and in the cdr terminal was adding the changes, then commiting them with the information about the changes, once I was happy with everything I worked with I was pushing it,so it is stored in Git Hub.
3. To make a shareable link of my project, once in the repository, I went into Settings, then in the Git Hub Pages sections in the source window I put master branch and /root file. I saved it and it created the link within the repository.
